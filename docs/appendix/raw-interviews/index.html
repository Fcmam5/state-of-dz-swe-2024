<p>In this page we share paraphrased transcripts and summaries from different interviews we had with different actors.</p>
<p>We kept the actors&#x27; identity anonymous, and we informed them that we will paraphrase and quote their answers here.</p>
<p>We cherry-picked these actors from our networks, or by asking for recommendations from people we trust, or by chasing interesting profiles online.</p>
<p>In order to provide an unbiased and objective analysis in this report, we cross-checked facts and validated conclusions form their anecdotes.</p>

<li>It is definitely hard to compete with salaries that remote working offer, if you have a startup in Algeria your revenues are in Algerian dinars, you can&#x27;t match salaries developers can get with remote working positions (especially that they&#x27;re in foreign currencies with high exchange rates).</li>
</ul><p>However, to retain talents we increased salaries, and we provide more perks for our developers such as credits to use some VTC services, business SIM cards, career growth and promotion programs, and we offer exceptional <em>gifts</em> for our loyal employees.</p><p>We can&#x27;t really compare salaries to what developers can get from remote working, those who work remotely generally don&#x27;t pay taxes, and CNAS/CASNOS.</p></div></div></details>

<li>My job security here [in the foreign country], labor laws and the economic situation provide a safe and a stable work environment.</li>
<li>Algerian laws and bureaucracy and banking systems are unclear, and navigating through them is more challenging with the lack of professionalism of some individuals, if you want to submit a certain application you might be stopped by a random agent stating that this law doesn&#x27;t exist, or we still didn&#x27;t receive a notice stating that this law is applicable.</li>

<li>
<p>If you are working as a contractor, or you are paid to perform a penetrating: Then you just need to document your findings and your recommendations to your client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are an external party, and you found a bug accidentally, for example it was too obvious or you can clearly see that they&#x27;re using a vulnerable version of a certain technology: Then you can &quot;try&quot; to contact them, you may try reaching out to them by email or through their public communication channels, or do the most realistic approach: Find a connection, or someone who knows someone so you can report it unofficially.</p>
<p>Since companies don&#x27;t have any bug bounty programs, they can&#x27;t just pay you for this, not in an &quot;official&quot; way at least. Sometimes a &quot;Thank you&quot; is the best/only thing you can get from them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you an external party, and you are not authorized to run a pentest or to scan their products, you may get into serious problems, at best you may get a call from the police, and at worst you can get into the court, or even worse if things gets to the National Defense Ministry (MDN).</p>
