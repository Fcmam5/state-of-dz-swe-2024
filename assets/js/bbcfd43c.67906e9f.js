After the cleanup phase, we want to merge inputs from all 3 forms programmatically then start processing them.\\n\\nOur survey used Google Forms, and we ran the research with 3 forms, one for each language ([Arabic](https://forms.gle/gZWWXLC9Gh1d1BJFA), [English](https://forms.gle/CCks5wiEXB7MgBqV7), and [French](https://forms.gle/D9GLGqS7bR3qQr43A)), therefor we have to merge them, then translate them to one language to make clustering and aggregation possible for us.\\n\\nThis second phase of clustering should produce our first output: A page for graphs per question (exactly as we were watching on our Google Forms UI).\\n\\nSince that page won\'t be enough, we want to go an extra mile and run analysis to extract insights by clustering data. We want to answer questions like: \\n\\n- What\'s the most used programming language? \\n- Do Algerians with no degrees in IT get paid as well as IT graduates?\\n- What roles IT are missing?\\n- Do Algerians move to other Wilayas for a job in IT? What perks (besides the salary) their jobs offer?\\n\\nSome answers cannot be answered with our data sample only, so we will need to interview experts who are working in the Algerian market, and/or have a long experience working in IT fields in Algeria. And that would be our phase three.\\n\\nThen in the last phase, we will draft a document in this website and publish it publicly.\\n\\n## When are we gonna publish the results?\\n\\nThat\'s one of the most frequent questions we had, and the answer is: Hopefully by Ramdhan, mid-March 2024.\\n\\nThis work will take time, and we all have jobs and personal responsibilities which prevents us from pushing more for this project to deliver it sooner.\\n\\n## Where will we publish the results? \\n\\nThe results will be published in [this](https://fcmam5.me/state-of-dz-swe-2024/) (https://fcmam5.me/state-of-dz-swe-2024/) website.\\n\\n## In which format?\\n\\nResults format will be textual, tabular and in graphs.\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Example</summary>\\n\\n**Do you live in Algeria?**\\n\\n```mermaid\\npie\\n    \\"Yes\\": 1\\n    \\"No\\": 1\\n    \\"Preferred not to say\\": 1\\n   \\n```\\n\\n|        Label         | Count |\\n| :------------------: | :---: |\\n|         Yes          |   1   |\\n|          No          |   1   |\\n| Preferred not to say |   1   |\\n</details>\\n\\n## How can I support?\\n\\nYou can support us by contributing to [this initiative\'s repository](https://github.com/Fcmam5/state-of-dz-swe-2024), by fixing typos, or by improving this website.\\n\\nYou can also contribute by asking questions you think our data can answer to have a richer website, and a more interesting analysis for everyone.\\n\\nAnd if you want to support me (Abdeldjalil), you are also very welcome to [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/fcmam5) online, or let\'s catch up to have a real coffee in Berlin, in Oran or probably anywhere else \u2615\ufe0f\ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddff.\\n\\nI refused, and I refuse to sell raw data. The raw answers/entries are not for sale! We stated in our privacy note that we won\'t share individual answers, and we keep that promise.\\n\\n## How can I stay notified when new results are published?\\n\\nWhen results are ready, I will publish the link to this website again on all of my social media ([@Fcmam5 on Twitter](https://twitter.com/fcmam5), on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fcmam5/), and on multiple groups on Facebook).\\n\\nI wouldn\'t enable Push notifications, or bother to ask you to insert your email to stay on touch.\\n\\n----\\n\\nUntil the results are ready, I wish you all happy and fun hacking!

It covers Algerians residing both in Algeria and abroad, regardless of whether they work full-time, part-time, or freelance, and whether they are employed by Algerian agencies or work remotely for foreign companies.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nOur goal is to gather input from our community to gain a better understanding of our industry\'s trends, average salaries, preferred Wilayas for engineers, and the most commonly used programming languages or CI/CD tools.\\n\\nThe primary goal of our survey is to provide a comprehensive overview of the Algerian landscape and to publicly share aggregated results from our three surveys on this website. This will enable all stakeholders to gain a deeper understanding of our field and identify potential opportunities for investment.\\n\\n\\n## FAQ\\n\\n### Who can participate in this survey?\\n\\nThis survey is open to **Algerians work in software engineering industry**. To the Algerians who work from Algeria either for local or foreign companies, on-site or remotely.\\n\\nThe survey also allocates a section for Algerians who live and work abroad.\\n\\nIf you are still a student and you are learning to hack and code, you must not participate but please keep an eye on the results, maybe this will answer some of your questions.\\n\\n### Is this survey anonymous?\\n\\nYes, as stated above and in the headers of our forms: The survey is anonymous, we do not record any personal data.\\n\\nWhen the survey is done, we will run a scan to make sure that no PIIs were added in free text inputs before we start processing results.\\n\\nThe results will be shared as aggregates, as numbers and percentages or graphs, we won\'t share individual entries to save people\'s privacy (we believe you are smart and that it\'s a smart world, so we don\'t trust anyone).\\n\\n### Where can I see the results\\n\\nWe will publish the results in this website and we will do our best to breakdown the results for a better analysis. We will also make sure to share the links to our results page to different channels of our social media (where you probably found out about this link).\\n\\n### Who can benefit from this survey?\\n\\nWe believe this survey can answer some questions we always ask, we want this survey to help:\\n\\n- **Startups** by highlighting the trends, as they may want to use technologies which are trending in the market to make their tech stacks attractive to talents. \\n- **Hiring managers and headhunters** by showing the trends in salaries and perks to better incentivize and attract talents.\\n- **Aspiring engineers and students** by highlighting the trends, the salaries and opportunities in the country or abroad. We want our new engineers to see what other Algerians are using.\\n- **Tech bloggers and IT schools** by highlighting what natural languages Algerian engineers are using, and what are their main interests.\\n- **Clubs, associations and government agencies** by highlighting the main non-technical challenges Algerians are facing.\\n- **Software engineers** by expanding the landscape they might know, and pointing to opportunities in other countries, other Wilayas, other working models, other industries, or for different tools and skills.\\n- **Entrepreneurs** who can see an opportunity in some of the challenges Algerians face, or who can invest in one of the strength they can see in from the results.\\n\\n### How can I participate?\\n\\nYou can fill one of the forms in the language you feel the most comfortable with:\\n\\n- For English: [https://forms.gle/CCks5wiEXB7MgBqV7](https://forms.gle/CCks5wiEXB7MgBqV7)\\n- For Arabic: [https://forms.gle/gZWWXLC9Gh1d1BJFA](https://forms.gle/gZWWXLC9Gh1d1BJFA)\\n- For French: [https://forms.gle/D9GLGqS7bR3qQr43A](https://forms.gle/D9GLGqS7bR3qQr43A)\\n\\nIf you want to support us more, please share this initiative with your network."}]}')}}]);
