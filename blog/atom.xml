        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After one month of <a href="https://state-of-algeria.dev/blog/kickstart-survey-2024">starting this initiative</a>, we come to end for this first sprint of collecting input.</p>
<p>We want to thank each and every one of you who participated, shared our links or gave constructive feedback.</p>
<p>Thanks to all who endorsed this initiative and shared it on their social media with their networks, and many thanks to all people who feedbacked the first drafts and iterations of the forms.</p>
<p>With this first sprint coming to an end, we are thrilled to start the second (and most fun ü§ì) part of our study: Cleaning up, then analyzing the data, then hopefully presented to you in a nice format in this website.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_PVHL" id="whats-next">What's next?<a href="https://state-of-algeria.dev/blog/2024-survey-closing#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's next?" title="Direct link to What's next?">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>In order to provide good insights, we want to go through each entry and cleanup fake or non-meaningful entries. After the cleanup phase, we want to merge inputs from all 3 forms programmatically then start processing them.</p>
<p>Our survey used Google Forms, and we ran the research with 3 forms, one for each language (<a href="https://forms.gle/gZWWXLC9Gh1d1BJFA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arabic</a>, <a href="https://forms.gle/CCks5wiEXB7MgBqV7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">English</a>, and <a href="https://forms.gle/D9GLGqS7bR3qQr43A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">French</a>), therefor we have to merge them, then translate them to one language to make clustering and aggregation possible for us.</p>
<p>This second phase of clustering should produce our first output: A page for graphs per question (exactly as we were watching on our Google Forms UI).</p>
<p>Since that page won't be enough, we want to go an extra mile and run analysis to extract insights by clustering data. We want to answer questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What's the most used programming language?</li>
<li>Do Algerians with no degrees in IT get paid as well as IT graduates?</li>
<li>What roles IT are missing?</li>
<li>Do Algerians move to other Wilayas for a job in IT? What perks (besides the salary) their jobs offer?</li>
</ul>
<p>Some answers cannot be answered with our data sample only, so we will need to interview experts who are working in the Algerian market, and/or have a long experience working in IT fields in Algeria. And that would be our phase three.</p>
<p>Then in the last phase, we will draft a document in this website and publish it publicly.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_PVHL" id="when-are-we-gonna-publish-the-results">When are we gonna publish the results?<a href="https://state-of-algeria.dev/blog/2024-survey-closing#when-are-we-gonna-publish-the-results" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to When are we gonna publish the results?" title="Direct link to When are we gonna publish the results?">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>That's one of the most frequent questions we had, and the answer is: Hopefully by Ramdhan, mid-March 2024.</p>
<p>This work will take time, and we all have jobs and personal responsibilities which prevents us from pushing more for this project to deliver it sooner.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In early February 2024 we initiated an effort to audit and assess the Algerian software engineering industry.</p>
<p>We have created a survey available in three languages: <a href="https://forms.gle/gZWWXLC9Gh1d1BJFA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arabic</a>, in <a href="https://forms.gle/CCks5wiEXB7MgBqV7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">English</a>, and in <a href="https://forms.gle/D9GLGqS7bR3qQr43A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">French</a>.</p>
<p>The objective of this survey is to identify trends and challenges within the Algerian IT sector. It covers Algerians residing both in Algeria and abroad, regardless of whether they work full-time, part-time, or freelance, and whether they are employed by Algerian agencies or work remotely for foreign companies.</p>
<p>Our goal is to gather input from our community to gain a better understanding of our industry's trends, average salaries, preferred Wilayas for engineers, and the most commonly used programming languages or CI/CD tools.</p>
<p>The primary goal of our survey is to provide a comprehensive overview of the Algerian landscape and to publicly share aggregated results from our three surveys on this website. This will enable all stakeholders to gain a deeper understanding of our field and identify potential opportunities for investment.</p>

<p>This survey is open to <strong>Algerians work in software engineering industry</strong>. To the Algerians who work from Algeria either for local or foreign companies, on-site or remotely.</p>
<p>The survey also allocates a section for Algerians who live and work abroad.</p>
<p>If you are still a student and you are learning to hack and code, you must not participate but please keep an eye on the results, maybe this will answer some of your questions.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_PVHL" id="is-this-survey-anonymous">Is this survey anonymous?<a href="https://state-of-algeria.dev/blog/kickstart-survey-2024#is-this-survey-anonymous" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Is this survey anonymous?" title="Direct link to Is this survey anonymous?">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Yes, as stated above and in the headers of our forms: The survey is anonymous, we do not record any personal data.</p>
<p>When the survey is done, we will run a scan to make sure that no PIIs were added in free text inputs before we start processing results.</p>
<p>The results will be shared as aggregates, as numbers and percentages or graphs, we won't share individual entries to save people's privacy (we believe you are smart and that it's a smart world, so we don't trust anyone).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_PVHL" id="where-can-i-see-the-results">Where can I see the results<a href="https://state-of-algeria.dev/blog/kickstart-survey-2024#where-can-i-see-the-results" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Where can I see the results" title="Direct link to Where can I see the results">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>We will publish the results in this website and we will do our best to breakdown the results for a better analysis. We will also make sure to share the links to our results page to different channels of our social media (where you probably found out about this link).</p>

<p>We believe this survey can answer some questions we always ask, we want this survey to help:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Startups</strong> by highlighting the trends, as they may want to use technologies which are trending in the market to make their tech stacks attractive to talents.</li>
<li><strong>Hiring managers and headhunters</strong> by showing the trends in salaries and perks to better incentivize and attract talents.</li>
<li><strong>Aspiring engineers and students</strong> by highlighting the trends, the salaries and opportunities in the country or abroad. We want our new engineers to see what other Algerians are using.</li>
<li><strong>Tech bloggers and IT schools</strong> by highlighting what natural languages Algerian engineers are using, and what are their main interests.</li>
<li><strong>Clubs, associations and government agencies</strong> by highlighting the main non-technical challenges Algerians are facing.</li>
<li><strong>Software engineers</strong> by expanding the landscape they might know, and pointing to opportunities in other countries, other Wilayas, other working models, other industries, or for different tools and skills.</li>
<li><strong>Entrepreneurs</strong> who can see an opportunity in some of the challenges Algerians face, or who can invest in one of the strength they can see in from the results.</li>
</ul>
