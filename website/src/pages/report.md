# ðŸš§ Report

This page is still in progress, this part of the work is deprioritized due to the overwhelming amount of work we have/had to ship.

You may [donate](https://ko-fi.com/fcmam5) to encourage us to continue work on this part, and summarize our findings in one printable PDF. Your donations may also contribute in paying creative designers, or paying for online tools for non-creative developers (like us) to ship the work in a nice format ðŸ˜….

If you can support us with this, head to our [support](/support) page or open a new [discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/Fcmam5/state-of-dz-swe-2024/discussions).
