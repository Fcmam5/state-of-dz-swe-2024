# Support Our Initiative

Thank you for visiting our website and showing interest in our research project! We've dedicated our time and resources to conduct a comprehensive survey and research study to benefit the Algerian developer community. Your support can help us make this initiative a success.

## Our Impact

Over the course of more than three months, while juggling a full-time job and personal commitments, my wife and I dedicated ourselves to conducting a comprehensive survey and research study to benefit the Algerian developer community. In this time, we collected 517 responses from Algerian developers, conducted extensive research, and interviewed industry experts. Our efforts have resulted in valuable insights that can empower developers and contribute to the growth of the tech industry in Algeria.
