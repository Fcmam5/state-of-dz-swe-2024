# Raw interviews (anonymous)

In this page we share paraphrased transcripts and summaries from different interviews we had with different actors.

We kept the actors' identity anonymous, and we informed them that we will paraphrase and quote their answers here.

We cherry-picked these actors from our networks, or by asking for recommendations from people we trust, or by chasing interesting profiles online.

In order to provide an unbiased and objective analysis in this report, we cross-checked facts and validated conclusions form their anecdotes.

## An executive in a tech startup

    How you incentivize talents? Especially since some of them flee to work remotely for possibly higher salaries 
    </summary>

    - It is definitely hard to compete with salaries that remote working offer, if you have a startup in Algeria your revenues are in Algerian dinars, you can't match salaries developers can get with remote working positions (especially that they're in foreign currencies with high exchange rates).

    However, to retain talents we increased salaries, and we provide more perks for our developers such as credits to use some VTC services, business SIM cards, career growth and promotion programs, and we offer exceptional *gifts* for our loyal employees.

    We can't really compare salaries to what developers can get from remote working, those who work remotely generally don't pay taxes, and CNAS/CASNOS.

    <summary>
    With the new data protection law and ANPDP behind it, how do you deal with data/compliance since you are running on [A PUBLIC CLOUD].
    </summary>

    We are aware of the law, and we work with our lawyers to clarify it. We know that there is a process and a document to apply for if you want to move your data to the cloud.

## A developer working abroad who's considering to go back to Algeria

<details>
    <summary>
    What are the parameters that would make you go ahead with your decision of going back?
    </summary>

    - I want to have a remote job, or a decent business in Algeria. I don't want to have a regular job in Algeria, but have my own business there.
    - I have to have a citizenship, or a permanent settlement permit from the country where I currently live in. Then I will be able to go back in Algeria while still having the freedom of movement, I want to travel for whatever reason I want, anytime I want, and my Algerian passport is not enough.

    But what I'm more concerned about is:

    - My job security here [in the foreign country], labor laws and the economic situation provide a safe and a stable work environment.
    - Algerian laws and bureaucracy and banking systems are unclear, and navigating through them is more challenging with the lack of professionalism of some individuals, if you want to submit a certain application you might be stopped by a random agent stating that this law doesn't exist, or we still didn't receive a notice stating that this law is applicable.
