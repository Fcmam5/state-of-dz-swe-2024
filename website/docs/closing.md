## Final thoughts

## ~~Solutions~~ Ideas and wishes

This document is not only meant for software development engineers or students. GOV, busines heads ..


## A *tbd...*

Although we put a lot of effort, time, energy, emotions and [some money](#) in this work it remains incomplete, and it will never be.

Our work is based on data collected from a survey we pushed very hard on social media, and it only collected 517 entry. These entries are not all significant, we had to filter a lot of them. Our data lacked a lot of profile that would have been interesting to explore (QA engineers, more R&D Engineers, etc). Hopefully with this work we gained the community trust, and we have more inputs in our survey for 2025 (إن شاء الله).

Few hours after publishing the survey on February 1st, I knew I missed having some important questions to ask, I wish I designed the survey better and asked whether our participants work in public or private sectors, and in which industry... These two questions would add more value to our analysis.

We respected our participants, we did not add, remove or change questions after clicking the button to make it live.

We did not share raw data with non-authorized people and only kept it private to those who worked on it. We were asked to "sell" our raw data by some parties and we refused because we promised you, our participants that we won't do it.

<br/>

We squeezed hours in our workdays and sacrificed our holidays and weekends to work on this job, so we took this long to perfect it, and get it to a respectable state.

We held ourselves from getting into rabbit holes and studying big topics and only talk about them from a software engineer, or more of a software developer point of view.

So, if you are reading this document from the future, be sure that we finally pulled the trigger and published this work after long months of work. If you still think that it's incomplete, you will be right, and the next sections might be for you.

### Topics to explore more

> TLDR; EVERYTHING. Algeria is a greenfield.

The next titles were amended in parallel to the work we were doing, we picked some of the topics here as TODOs for us and covered them, and to not get into rabbit holes we left you, the community some ideas to explore!

#### Cybersecurity

To not shift away from the generic "State of Algerian software engineering" domain this report covers, I would just scratch the surface on this topic.

Cybersecurity topic needs to be covered by professionals, this topic needs a lot of research and investigation due to the lack of -*recent*- data that covers Algeria.

In some academic publications, researchers claim that there were/are gaps in Algerian regulations. This has to be investigated by technical/legal people.

A field study has to be done to investigate whether laws and decisions are applied. If the different agencies are actually working on the field and they are collaborating with talents.

The tooling and practices used by engineers and teams can also be explored.

#### Internships

When I was at university, it was clearer and easier for me to get an internship abroad than in Algeria. But from this survey's data I see that there are opportunities, these opportunities sometimes offer good salaries for interns!

Students and newbies in Algeria need to know more about this, we need to democratize information about internships and other ways to break through the professional world.

A document has to be published to show how to get internships? What's needed form the university? How and where companies can publish their positions? What's the legal framework in such situations?

Job portals should offer and promote positions for interns if possible.


### Unanswered questions or unexplored correlations

If you think that we did not answer your questions in this work, let us know. But please, consider [supporting us](/support) to continue maintaining this project.

> I, Abdeldjalil won't be happy to work with Excel or Python to find anymore correlations for free. A donation may make me change my mind, or pay Oussama to do it for me.

## Final words

I hope we delivered an insightful document with a decent quality, and I hope that some people see into the challenges and act on them.

This document intentionally tried to have a positive note despite of the necessity to be objective. Finding opportunities and lifting challenges are one of the promises we promoted our work with, and we do believe that there are hunters who would see business opportunities in our data.

This document has bits and pieces that pin-point to the fact that things are moving forward, not judging if it's the right timing, the right speed, or in the right directions. We just wanted to draw a landscape and show its green parts.

I'm sorry if this work was incomplete, or it wasn't up to your standards, or if you had to read through long pages without getting the value you expected.

I'm sorry if I missed something unintentionally.

I hope we will have a more solid work in the next one, with sponsors and with a dedicated and a professional team.
