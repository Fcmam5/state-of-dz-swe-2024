### Cybersecurity


To not shift away from the generic "State of Algerian software engineering" domain this report covers, I would just scratch the surface on this topic.

Cybersecurity topic needs to be covered by professionals, this topic needs a lot of research and investigation due to the lack of -*recent*- data that covers Algeria.

In some academic publications, researchers claim that there were/are gaps in Algerian regulations. This has to be investigated by technical/legal people.

A field study has to be done to investigate whether laws and decisions are applied. If the different agencies are actually working on the field and they are collaborating with talents.

The tooling and practices used by engineers and teams can also be explored.
