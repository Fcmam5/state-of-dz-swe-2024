## Methodology

The survey was fielded form February 1st to [End Date], and collected [Number of Participants].

We estimated that the survey should take between 5 to 10 minutes to complete. The form was first designed in English then we made sure to translate it to Arabic and French.

We used [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) to capture answers to have a user experience that our participants are used to, and because it was a free and easy option to go for.

The survey was anonymous, we didn't collect any personal identifiable information, and we didn't use any analytics tools on the forms, or on [the landing page](/blog/kickstart-survey-2024/).

### Confidentiality & data usage

Participation in the survey was entirely voluntary. All responses were kept confidential. No personally identifiable information were collected or disclosed in any reports or publications.

All data was analyzed and reported in aggregate, ensuring that individual responses cannot be traced back to specific participants.

To ensure compliance with Algerian regulations, we went through the law NÂ°18-07, and we requested a confirmation from [ANPDP](https://anpdp.dz/fr/quand-et-a-qui-sapplique-la-loi-n18-07/) that we are not collecting any personally identifiable information.

### Data analysis

In the first phase of our data analysis we mapped data from different forms with [our script ](https://github.com/Fcmam5/state-of-dz-swe-2024/tree/master/data-processing). Then we cleaned up our data from fake entries.

To determine "fake entries" we cross checked some inputs, compared salaries to role and experience levels and checked free-text answers.

We then conducted a set of interviews with experts and active members of Algerian tech community so collect more insights from them, to understand our results and to enrich our final report.
