## Workspaces

According to our survey data, 95% of the participants who work remotely from Algeria work from their homes, 8% use public places like cafeterias and libraries, and only 7% use co-working spaces.

To investigate this further more we [interviewed](/docs/appendix/raw-interviews) several personas.

Engineers who work remotely may not use workspaces for the follwing reasons:

- **Logistics:** 
  - Some co-working spaces are located in city centers or in places that are challenging to reach with public transport, or by car due to traffic jams. Engineers prefer to work from home and save the commute time.
  - Some engineers reported many issues with Internet and connectivity, in one of the interviews, a developer stated:
    > I always have my 4G modem with me, once we had an internet problem while being in a workspace, when we reported it to the manager he offered to make his personal phone as a Wi-Fi hotspot.
- **Workspaces being places for networking and events:**
  - Some co-working spaces tend to run different workshops and networking events, this might not be suitable for engineers and developers who want to have a calm place where they can focus for long hours.
  - Some co-working places don't provide a dedicated setup for having e-meetings and calls, which is not optimal in a remote working setup.
- **The culture:**
  - A co-working place owner reported that developers and engineers in general "are not very social", which might clash with the open and social culture of a shared working space.
  - Developers reported that co-working spaces are for socializing and for non-work related activities, which is both not interesting and distracting.
- **Unavailability:**
  - Some small wilayas don't have co-working spaces, and in the big wilayas traffic jams and the long commute to these places makes it less appealing of a choice.

According to different participants; membership costs are not an issue, especially if they are working for foreign companies and getting paid in foreign currencies.
