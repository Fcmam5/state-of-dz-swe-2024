# Data and Machine learning

Algeria is improving in terms of "[information society](https://www.mpt.gov.dz/en/what-is-the-information-society/)" and Knowledge Economy, both from governmental side and from private sectors.

The government is moving towards Algeria's national vision for 2030. By establishing the [Knowledge Economy, Startups and Micro-enterprises](#) ministry and running multiple digitalization projects in different areas. The government even went to creating an "elite" [National School of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ensia.edu.dz/).

Private sector, and startups are mining data and making use of it to better leverage information technology in optimizing growth and profit.

On a global level, data science and machine learning are trending, especially with the widespread of LLMs and different generative AI models that got more "human" and closer to average non-technical consumers with different ChatBot applications. This trend may get people's interest into adopting this field as a profession, or hire professionals in this domain.

In this section of our report, we will answer several questions:

## Are there any data-protection laws in Algeria?

Yes, the law [N°18-07 (governed by ANPDP)](https://anpdp.dz/fr/quand-et-a-qui-sapplique-la-loi-n18-07/) specifies how data is handled.

## Where Algerian data scientists and ML engineers work?

According to our survey participants, the majority (70%) of data and machine learning engineers work on-site (or have a hybrid working model) for companies in the same country they live in. 11% work for remotely from Algeria for foreign companies.

We see that some candidates work as full-time freelance data engineers while others do freelance in addition to their full-time or part-time jobs.

According to our data, engineers who work in Algerian companies are mostly based in Algiers, and according to separate research, we also found that most of the companies who hire data and machine learning engineers are based in Algiers. Some examples are listed under "[Are there any companies who use data science and ML in Algeria?](#are-there-any-companies-who-use-data-science-and-ml-in-algeria)" section of this page.

However, we see that some Algerians did have some freelance opportunities on Upwork for [data engineering/analysis](https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/talent/?category_uid=531770282580668420&loc=algeria&nss=80&revenue=1&rising_talent=yes&top_rated_plus=yes&top_rated_status=top_rated&page=1) and for [machine learning](https://www.upwork.com/nx/search/talent/?category_uid=531770282580668420&loc=algeria&nss=80&revenue=1&rising_talent=yes&subcategory_uid=531770282593251329&top_rated_plus=yes&top_rated_status=top_rated) gigs.

We also see that some data scientists and AI/ML engineers work in academia, such as [Dr. Taha Zerrouki](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Taha-Zerrouki) who leads NLP projects for Arabic language.

## Is there any "data" in Algeria?

> TLDR; Yes and No.

Data can be sourced from different streams:

### Government agencies

With more digitalization and modernization, many government agencies started publishing public data for transparency, and to attract investors and innovators.

However, many other agencies are lacking behind, or still showing outdated data (e.g. [National office of statistics](https://www.ons.dz/) still have data from 2019).

### Public data

Public data can be obtained by crawling different sources, or by consuming ready-to-use datasets which are available from different sources.

### Applications and websites

As the collection and the management of personal data is regulated under tha law [ANPDP](https://anpdp.dz/fr/quand-et-a-qui-sapplique-la-loi-n18-07/), websites and applications can collect data to improve their users' experience and to better understand their client base.

### Research and surveys


Surveys like ours ([Algeria Developer Survey](/blog/kickstart-survey-2024/)) may also provide some data to study and to perform analysis.

In academia, research labs can get access to internal datasets from different parties.

## Are there any companies who use data science and ML in Algeria?
