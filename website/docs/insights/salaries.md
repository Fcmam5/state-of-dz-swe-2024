# Salaries

In this section we present insights from our survey, examining salaries, variation by experience and location. Salaries within the Algerian software engineering and IT sector operate in a dynamic and unregulated landscape. With the potential to range from **20 000 DZD** Algerian dinars to more than **150 000 DZD** (per month), compensation packages reflect a wide spectrum influenced by various factors such as experience, skillset, location, and employer practices.

Our participants' monthly salary distribution was the following:

```mermaid
pie
    "less than 60 000 DZD" : 71
    "less than 100 000 DZD" : 54
    "less than 80 000 DZD" : 52
    "less than 150 000 DZD" : 36
    "more than 150 000 DZD" : 35
    "less than 40 000 DZD" : 25
    "I'm volunteering; or I work for free" : 21
    "less than 20 000 DZD" : 5
```

To understand these number better, we broke down the numbers by professional levels and years of experience.
