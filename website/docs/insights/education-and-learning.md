# Education and learning

We asked our participants about their levels of education and we had the following distribution:

```mermaid
pie title Participants by level of education
    "Master's Degree in a non IT-related field" : 66
    "Master's Degree in an IT-related field" : 289
    "Bachelor's Degree in an IT-related field" : 65
    "High school (Baccalauréat)" : 41
    "Ph.D. or equivalent" : 21
    "Bachelor's Degree in a non IT-related field" : 24
    "Secondary school (BEM, BEF)" : 2
```

The majority (65%) of the participants have a master's degree, and 4% have a Ph.D or an equivalent qualification.

In this page we will explore the relation between academic degrees (formal education) and software engineering craftsmanship.

## Education landscape

To not shift away from the generic "State of Algerian software engineering" domain this report covers, I would just scratch the surface on this topic. Why? [Read more here](/docs/closing#education).

### High-school

Algerian students study for 3 years in high-schools, after passing Brevet d’Enseignement Moyen (BEM) a national exam to leave lower secondary schools (college or CEM).

TBD mention:

- Languages and social studies (lettres)
- Sciences (natural and physical)
- Technology (mathematics, physical sciences and technology).
- gestion

TBD: mention the fact that one can miss the chance to end in a technical branch if the mess it up in CEM, or HS.

## Does having a degree affect the chances of finding a job?

To answer this question we crawled the biggest employment platform and fetched 48 job postings for software developers, 93% of them required a degree.
